        <p>Here at Puntsquad, we use <strong>complex quantitative models</strong> to generate probabilities of outcomes for a wide range of sporting events. In other words, we have a purely objective and unbiased approach towards betting based off far more data and statistics than any human instinct/gut/hunch possibly could.</p></div>

        <p>The Models we use for each sport takes account a vast volume of information, with countless numbers of unseen variables. It aims to best predict the fair odds (winning %) of any given outcome in a match including but not limited to; head-to-head, lines and totals markets. The calculated fair odds will be then compared with bookmakers to identify any overlay.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <h1><i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-3x"></i></h1>
          <p>EV stands for Expected Value. Simply put when you blindly bet on an outcome, that bet must fall into one of the 3 categories: negative EV (-EV), breakeven EV (=), and positive EV (+EV). Here at Puntsquad we aim only to offer +EV tips, where the price offered is better than the likelihood of the outcome occurring, and hence we expect to make money and come out ahead in the long run.  </p>

        <div class="panel-body"><h1><i class="fa fa-percent fa-3x"></i></h1>
        <p>Return On Investment (ROI) is calculated by the total returns divided by the total amount bet (total turnover). Note this percentage is not an indication of total profit of initial investment, as your initial investment will be turned over countless times. For total return on investment, simply look at Units won (1unit = 1% of initial investment). Puntsquad aims to achieve a minimum of 5% ROI on all products, which means that you, the punter can expect to make 5 cents off every dollar you bet on average in the long run.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-body"><h1><i class="fa fa-line-chart fa-3x"></i></h1>
        <p>Variance can either be your worst enemy or your best friend. A coin-flip should be 50/50. If you flip 10 times in a perfect world, you would get 5 heads and 5 tails. However real-life is not like this. We will do our best to offer tips that SHOULD turn you a profit in the long run, but variance could mean you will make a loss on those tips as nothing is guaranteed. Here at Puntsquad, we ask all our members to focus on the long-run, and to ride out the short-term variances that may arise. As of 13/10/16, our largest downswing has been -65 units meaning if you had started at the peak, you would have lost 65% of your initial investment. Such things do happen, but have faith in the models to rebound.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-body"><h1><i class="fa fa-usd fa-3x"></i></h1>
        <p>Puntsquad tips are displayed in units. Each unit is simply 1% of your initial investment or available capital. For instance, if you decide to set out $10,000, then each unit will be $100. Similarly, if you decide to bet $50 for each unit, then it is recommended that you have at least $5000 set aside to counteract any bad variance that may occur. This method of management for your betting bankroll is strongly recommended. All tips are based off the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj7IXfed2xM"><strong>Kelly Criterion</strong></a>.</p></div>

When specific sports/days/meets are completed, you will be notified via email, though it may help to constantly keep an eye out for bets as they come up as to guarantee the best odds. We recommend bets be placed ASAP as you receive them. We expect our tips to be accurate and true and assume that late “smart money” will always go in our favour more often than not.

        <p>We are not affiliated with any bookmakers. We strongly urge anyone who is paying for tipping services that are affiliated/offer bonuses with specific bookmakers, to stop immediately. All bookmakers offer referral programs in which they pay out a % of your loss back to the referrer. 90% of all tipping services will act in this manner, not only charging you a subscription fee, but also giving bad tips for you to lose. We will not name and shame, but please be aware that this does occur very frequently.</p></div>

      <div class="well FAQ">
        <h3>Q: Which Bookmaker should I use?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Even though we are not affiliated with any bookmakers, we will oddscheck to bring you the best odds (at the time of release) from all Australian bookmakers: TAB, Sportsbet, Crownbet, Luxbet, Unibet, William Hill, Bet365, Ubet, Madbookie, Ladbrokes, Palmerbet and Pinnacle, an international book (trusted). To maximise your profit, it is essential that you create an account with all of the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Bookmark all of the above sites, and open and log in to each account in separate tabs under one window prior to placing bets each. <u>This will save you a lot of time navigating back and forth.</u>

        <h3>Q: Odds have dropped compared to what is being tipped on Puntsquad. Is the bet still +EV? Should I place it?</h3>
        <p>
          A: The bets that we recommend all have surpassed a minimum overlay threshold, which means even though the odds have dropped, it could still be +EV. As a general rule if a horse racing bet has dropped more than 10% or a sports bet has dropped more than 5% from the odds we have tipped it, then it should be faded (avoided). However larger odds bets such as a horse going from $101 -> $25 could still be +EV.
        </p>

          <strong>We encourage you to email/message us at PuntSquad if you are uncertain of whether to take a bet once the odds have changed. This is included as a part of the service you are paying for. It will also help us to better keep records of results and odds as we will know what odds most members are getting, and in turn improve our service. Thank you.</strong>

      <div class="well FAQ">
        <h3>Q: There are so many bets, do I need to place all of them or none at all?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Each bet is independent on their own, meaning if you decide (not recommended) to pick and choose bets on your own accord, in the long-run your ROI is still expected to be the same. However, the fewer bets will mean less turnover, and the same ROI at the smaller volume of bets will mean less profit for you. In short, the tips offered at Puntsquad is not a ‘system’. Our sizing and bets will not change because of the results of other bets. It is up to you to decide whether you wish to place all the bets that you pay us to see.
